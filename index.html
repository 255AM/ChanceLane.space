        <h1>Chance Lane</h1>
        <!-- 
        <p>I am from Virgina, also West Virginia</p>
        <p>Spent many nights in bed as a kid, looking at posters of Atari 2600 games, and imagining how great they must be</p>
        <p>My dad brought home a used Atari 800XL for me when I was young. I spent hours copying lines of code out of a guide in order to make the screen flash a couple of times. Had no idea what I was doing, but thought it was pretty cool!</p>
        <p>Joined the Marine Corps. Got out after 4 years intent on taking over the world</p> 
        <p>Went to college, got a job, had a lot of fun, got in trouble, dropped out of college, went back to college, had a lot more fun, dropped out of college, got in more trouble, decided I never really wanted to take over the world.
        <p>Met a girl who saved me! </p>
        <p>Followed her to West Virginia</p> 
        <p>Followed her to Chicago</p> 
        <p>Followed her back to West Virginia, where she gave in and married me</p> 
        <p>Followed the wife to Louisville</p> 
        <p>Assisted in creating 2 amazing boys</p>
        <p>Still having fun, but a different kind these days</p>        
        <p>Places I've called home during my travels: <br>Virginia<br>West Virginia<br>North Carolina<br>Texas<br>Japan<br>Chicago<br>Louisville</p>
        <p>Places I've travelled to: <br>Mexico<br>Spain<br>Italy<br>Thailand<br>Greece<br>Egypt<br>Turkey<br>Jordan<br>Kosovo<br>Andora<br>Malta<br>France</p>
        <p>Jobs I've done along the way:<br> carwash<br> construction<br> HVAC<br> marine<br> aircraft firefighter<br> credit fraud investigation<br> arcade machine<br> juke box and pool table repair<br> private eye<br>air balancer<br> work at Ford assembly plants that would take too long to explain<br> software QA<br> blackbox tester<br> and technical editor</p>
